Lemons are much more than just some yellow fruits with a sour taste; besides adding an interesting, strong taste to your cooked chicken or drank as fresh lemonades or tea, lemons can also be used in many different ways and with different purposes, like skin youth, hair health providing or even deodorizing your house. Here are some interesting uses of this colorful, loved fruit:

## Lemons can make metal surfaces to shine

Because they contain an acid named citric acid, lemons can be a special polish method for metal surfaces like stainless steel, chrome or aluminum. All you have to do is to simply cut a lemon in half and scrub the surface of these metal objects to provide a shiny, polished texture. If you want maximum results, you can mix some lemon juice with baking soda or table salt and the surfaces will be perfectly and gentle polished, without leaving scratches or other marks.

## Kill unwanted weeds from your garden

This is an efficient method for your garden if you spray some lemon juice on the plants, but keeping the acid from the lemons away from flowers of bushes because it can also kill ‘the good green guys’ too.

For your clothing outfits, you can add plenty of lemon juice on the stain and then sprinkle some salt and rubbing it inside the fibers. Then, put your clothes in the washing machine, and the results are surprising. For your rugs, do the same and then, use your vacuum cleaner to remove the extra salt that remained on the carpet.
