Candida is an infection determined by a fungus belonging to the Candida family. There are 80 species of Candida, and the most harmful ones are Albicans and Tropicalis.
Most of us carry the fungus Candida, without any sign of disease. Candida exists in the intestines, vagina, mouth or on the skin. This fungus can survive in your body for many years in a row, without any symptom, but there are chances for an infection to appear suddenly, at some point. Moreover, symptoms can change daily at the same person. This is the reason due to which an individual may experience genital candida and migraines, and another one can have allergies, oral ulcerations, and constant fatigue. Considering the are where it is located, candida can be oral, cutaneous, genital, intestinal or systemical.

##Oral candida##
Oral candida is an infection which develops in the mouth, on the tongue, and in the neck area. This type of infection is frequently located at newborn children. The symptoms are white lesions or a white layer in the baby’s mouth, with a cheesy aspect, and a low appetite. 
At newborn children, oral candida is not to be considered a major problem, since it can be easily treated by washing the oral cavity with a soft and wet material. If the baby is breastfed, then it is highly recommended to wash the breasts with an anti-fungus solution. 
As adults, after the tongue and the internal surface of the cheeks turns a vivid red and they are sticky and dried, some creamy white deposits appear, which is easily removable when the tongue is cleaned.

##Intestinal candida##
Intestinal candida at newborn children is usually associated with the oral candida. The symptoms are digestive disorders, such as vomiting, low appetite, diarrhea. Another symptom which is to look at carefully is the redness of the baby’s but cheeks, which disappears after the infection is gone. 
At adults, the intestinal candida displays various symptoms, such as abdominal disorders, diarrhea or constipation, a bad change in the general mood, and in more severe cases, diarrhea with blood and colitis. 

##Genital Candida##
Usually, candida affects the feminine genital organs, frequently determining vaginal yeast infections. In a healthy body, Candida Albicans exists in the vaginal flora, but when the vaginal PH is disturbed or when the immune system is not working adequately, the balance between candida and other microorganisms within the vaginal flora is lost. The symptoms which appear are itchiness, burns, white vaginal discharges, hurtful urination and severe sexual intercourse. 
At men, genital candida has no symptoms, but if the female partner has candida, it is very probable that also man will get it.

##What causes candida?##
As it was already mentioned, when an imbalance takes place within the normal and healthy flora, Candida Albicans has the perfect conditions to develop infections either in the intestines, in the mouth or the vagina.
An inefficient immune system is the main responsible with the infection’s development. Also, the excessive intake of antibiotics can seriously damage the healthy flora within the body. Unprotected sexual intercourse is considered one of the main casualties of genital candida, along with inappropriate genital hygiene. 

##How is the mind affected by this disorder?##
This infection has a kind of interesting connection with the sexual relationship in a couple. There comes a moment when women do not feel free enough to express how they feel regarding certain aspects of the relationship and so conflicts appear. When all the symptoms of candida infection are added, things get a whole other aspect. This is the case when they feel like turning to a physical and sexual protection, because the symptoms of the infection, such as irritation, do not allow them to enjoy the sexual act fully. 
Although maybe the body passes through a not very good phase, one should try to adopt a healthy attitude, along with a healthy diet and healthy hygiene habits. Any medical treatment you follow has a lot more winning chances when you add a little optimism.

##Prevent candida with a probiotic diet##
Bifidobacteria or friendly bacteria as they are also known have the essential role of increasing the acidity through the lactic acid production. They also are great in inhibiting unwanted microorganisms, which are the worst enemies of the healthy bacteria already existing in our systems.
The primary useful bacteria in the process of refreshing the flora are Lactobacillus acidophilus, which lives in the small intestine; Bifidobacterium bifidum, existing in the large intestine and the vagina, and Lactobacillus bulgaricus and Streptococcus thermophiles, that also produce lactic acid when they pass through the intestines. 
This type of friendly bacteria are contained in yogurt, and this is why it is such a recommended food, in case there isn’t any lactose intolerance. 
So you have a prevention alternative, but what can you do when the body, hence the genital area, is already infected with this fungus?[https://www.healthbreakingnews.com/myths-facts-probiotics/](https://www.healthbreakingnews.com/myths-facts-probiotics/)

##Natural relief of candida symptoms within 24 hours##
A first trick would be to use all- natural yogurt or kefir for cleaning the vaginal area. It is best if you can use homemade yogurt because this is how you will be sure that no additives were added. 
Prepare a mixture between 2 scoops of apple vinegar or the juice from half a lemon and 1 liter of water. Use it for vaginal washes, but if you feel some burns, you should immediately give it up.
Carefully peel a clove and cover it in mull. Band it with dental floss and use it as an internal tampon for about 4 hours. In the first 5 minutes you may feel some burns, but later on, you will feel a great relief of candida’s symptoms.
